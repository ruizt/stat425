Please prepare your solutions neatly, numbered, and in order; ideally, you'll write up a final clean copy after completing all problems on scratch paper. Please note that if a prompt includes a question, you're expected to support answers with reasoning, even if the prompt does not explicitly ask for a justification. Provide your name at the top of your submission, and if you collaborate with other students in the class, please list their names at the top of your submission beneath your own.

1.  (Hypergeometric distribution) Imagine a clown car with 50 clowns; suppose that 20 of them are happy clowns and 30 of them are sad clowns.

    i.  If 10 clowns exit the car sequentially and at random, what is the probability that exactly 3 are sad clowns?
    ii. If 10 clowns exit the car sequentially and at random, what is the probability that exactly $k$ are sad clowns? (Assume $0\leq k \leq 10$.)
    iii. If $n$ clowns exit the car sequentially and at random, what is the probability that exactly $k$ are sad clowns? (Assume $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $n < 50$.)
    iv. If the car contains $N$ happy clowns and $M$ sad clowns and $n \leq N + M$ exit the car sequentially and at random, what is the probability that $k$ are happy clowns (for $0 \leq k \leq n$)?

2.  Consider rolling two six-sided dice. The sample space is $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}^2$. Assuming the dice are fair, each outcome $(i, j)$ has equal probability $p$. Consider the event that the dice sum to $k$: $E_k = \{(i, j)\in S: i + j = k\}$.

    i.  Find $|S|$ and $p$.
    ii. Find $|E_k|$ in terms of $k$.
    iii. Make a table of the probabilities $P(E_k)$.
    iv. Interpret the event $\bigcup_{k = 1}^m E_k$ and find $P\left(\bigcup_{k = 1}^m E_k\right)$ (assuming $1\leq m \leq 12$).
    
*Hint*: you may find the proof of SWR2 helpful in answering part (ii); however, there are multiple ways to solve the problem.
