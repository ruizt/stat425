Please prepare your solutions neatly, numbered, and in order; ideally, you'll write up a final clean copy after completing all problems on scratch paper. Please note that if a prompt includes a question, you're expected to support answers with reasoning, even if the prompt does not explicitly ask for a justification. Provide your name at the top of your submission. If you collaborate with other students in the class, please list their names at the top of your submission beneath your own.

1.  In a *serial* system, components are linked together in such a way that the system only works if every component works. For example, consider a string of Christmas lights; if one light goes out, the whole string goes out. Suppose that one has a serial system with $k$ components that all function independently of one another. The state of the system can be represented by a binary vector $x = (x_1, \dots, x_k)$ where the coordinate $x_i$ indicates whether the $i$th component is working. The relevant sample space is the set of all possible values of $x$, that is, $S = \{(x_1, \dots, x_k): x_i \in \{0, 1\}\}$, so that the system states are the outcomes, and the events are all possible subsets $\mathcal{S} = 2^S$. Let $E_i \in \mathcal{S}$ denote the event that the $i$th component works.

    i.  Express the sample space $S$ as a Cartesian product.
    ii. Express the event $E_i$ as a set in terms of the system states $x \in S$.
    iii. Find the number of system states $|S|$.
    iv. Find the number of possible events $|\mathcal{S}|$.
    v.  Is $\{E_i\}$ a disjoint collection? Why or why not?

2.  Continuing the example in the previous question (serial prompts, anyone?), express each of the following events in terms of the collection $\{E_i\}$.

    i.  The first component works and the second component fails.
    ii. The first three components work.
    iii. The system works.
    iv. The system fails.
    v.  Exactly one component fails.

3.  Consider now a *parallel* system of $k$ components --- one which works just in case at least one component works. Using the same notation as above, express the event that the system fails.

4.  Consider the monotone sequences of sets defined by $A_n = [0, 1 + \frac{1}{n})$ and $B_n = [0, 1 - \frac{1}{n})$.

    i.  Is $\{A_n\}$ increasing or decreasing?
    ii. Is $\{B_n\}$ increasing or decreasing?
    iii. True or false: $\lim_{n \rightarrow\infty} A_n = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} B_n$? Explain. (*Hint*: $x \in \bigcup_n C_n$ just in case $x \in C_n$ for at least one $n$; similarly, $x \in \bigcap_n C_n$ just in case $x \in C_n$ for every $n$.)

5.  Consider the "experiment" of rolling 2 six-sided dice.

    i.  Write the sample space for this experiment.
    ii. Write the set of all possible events.
    iii. If $P(E) = 1$ whenever $E = (1, 1)$ and $P(E) = 0$ otherwise, is $P$ a valid probability measure?
    iv. If $P(E) = 1$ whenever $(1, 1) \in E$ and $P(E) = 0$ otherwise, is $P$ a valid probability measure?

6.  Consider the triple $(S, \mathcal{S}, P)$ where:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    S &= [0, 1] \\
    \mathcal{S} &= \left\{A \subseteq S: A \text{ is a countable union or intersection of open or closed intervals or their complements}\right\} \\
    P(E) &= \int_E dx,\quad E\in\mathcal{S} \qquad\text{(i.e., total length of $E$)}
    \end{align*}
    $$

    i.  Show that $(S, \mathcal{S}, P)$ is a probability space by verifying the requisite conditions on $\mathcal{S}$ and $P$.
    ii. Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the Cantor set. Show that $P(\mathcal{C}) = 0$.

7.  Let $(S, \mathcal{S}, P)$ be a probability space, and let $\{E_i\}$ be a collection of events. Show that if $\{E_i\}$ is a finite or countable partition of any event $A \subseteq S$, then $\sum_i P(E_i) = P(A)$.

8.  Prove Bonferroni's inequality: $P\left(\bigcap_{i = 1}^n E_i\right) \geq 1 - \sum_{i = 1}^n P\left(E^C\right)$.
