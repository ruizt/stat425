### Midterm details and scope

The midterm exam will be given in class on Thursday, October 19. Here are the logistical details:

-   50 minutes in duration
-   you're allowed one double-sided note sheet on standard 8.5 x 11 paper
-   scratch paper will be available
-   3 problems in length
-   no calculator required

 Problems will draw on material from weeks 1-3, plus material covered Monday of week 4. You can expect one probability rules problem (week 1), one counting problem (week 2), and one conditional probability problem (week 3).

### Topics to review

#### Probability rules

-   set concepts and operations

-   set cardinality

-   DeMorgan's laws

-   events, disjoint events, partitions

-   probability axioms

-   probability rules

    -   complement rule
    -   monotonicity
    -   union rule
    -   limits for monotone sequences of events
    -   countable sub-additivity (Boole's inequality)
    -   finite sub-additivity
    -   Bonferroni's inequality

-   construction of probability measures on finite sample spaces

#### Counting

-   multiplication rules for counting

-   counting rules for combinations of elements drawn from a finite set

    -   ordered and drawn with replacement
    -   ordered and drawn without replacement
    -   unordered and drawn with replacement
    -   unordered and drawn without replacement

#### Conditional probability

-   definition of conditional probability

-   multiplication rules for conditional probability

-   law of total probability

-   definition of independence, pairwise independence, and mutual independence
