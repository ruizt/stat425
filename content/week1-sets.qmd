### Concepts

A [set]{style="color: blue"} is a collection of mathematical objects such as numbers, points, functions, or more sets.

If an object $x$ is in a set $A$, we say that $x$ is an [element]{style="color:blue"} of $A$ and write $x \in A$ to mean "$x$ is in $A$". Otherwise, we write $x \not\in A$.

We write a set by identifying its elements. For example:

$$
A =\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
$$

Two sets $A, B$ are [identical]{style="color:blue"} just in case they have exactly the same elements:

$$
A = B
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
x \in A \Leftrightarrow x \in B
$$

### Special sets

There are some special notations for the sets of numbers:

-   $\mathbb{R}$: real numbers
-   $\mathbb{N}$: natural numbers
-   $\mathbb{Z}$: integers
-   $\mathbb{C}$: complex numbers
-   $\mathbb{Q}$: rational numbers

Similarly, open, closed, and half-open real intervals are denoted:

$$
\begin{align*}
[a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x \leq b\} \\
(a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x \leq b\} \\
[a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x < b\} \\
(a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x < b\}
\end{align*}
$$

### Containment

If all the elements of a set $A$ are also in $B$, then we say that $A$ is contained in $B$, or that $A$ is a [subset]{style="color:blue"} of $B$, and write $A \subseteq B$. (Containment is a binary relation and defines a partial ordering on the set of all sets.)

$$
A \subseteq B 
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B
$$

Further, $A$ is a [proper subset]{style="color: blue"} of $B$ just in case there is at least one element of $B$ that is not in $A$:

$$
A \subset B 
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
A \subseteq B \text{ and } A \neq B
$$

Both relations are transitive:

-   If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$ then $A \subseteq C$

-   If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$ then $A \subset C$

### Null set

Lastly it may happen that a set contains *no* elements. This set is called the [null set]{style="color: blue"} (or empty set) and is denoted $\emptyset = \{ \}$.

For a small brain teaser, prove that every set contains the null set: for any set $A$, $\emptyset \subseteq A$. Intuitively, this is true; but why, based on the definitions, must it hold? (*Hint*: the conditional "if $p$ then $q$" is trivially true if $p$ is always false.)

### Set operations

The two fundamental set operations are union and intersection. Let $A, B$ be sets and define:

-   [(union)]{style="color: blue"} $A \cup B = \{x: x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$
-   [(intersection)]{style="color: blue"} $A \cap B = \{x: x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$

Both operations are [associative]{style="color: blue"}:

$$
\begin{align*}
A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C \\
A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C
\end{align*}
$$

And [distributive]{style="color: blue"}:

$$
\begin{align*}
A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \\
A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)
\end{align*}
$$

Proofs are direct and left as an exercise: apply definitions of union/intersection and show that the conditions specified by each construction are equivalent. The properties follow, essentially, from the meanings of "and" and "or".

The operation of [set difference]{style="color: blue"} corresponds to removing the elements of one set from another set:

$$
A \setminus B = \{x: x \in A \text{ and } x \not\in B\}
$$

Set difference is *not* distributive over unions and intersections, but rather exhibits the following properties:

$$
\begin{align*}
A \setminus (B \cap C) = (A \setminus B) \cup (A \setminus C) \\
A \setminus (B \cup C) = (A \setminus B) \cap (A \setminus C)
\end{align*}
$$

We'll review the proof in class.

Lastly, the [Cartesian product]{style="color: blue"} between sets is the set of all possible pairs of elements from each set:

$$
A \times B = \{(a, b): a \in A, b \in B\}
$$

The $n$-fold product of a set $A$ with itself is written $A^n$:

$$
A^n = \{(a_1, \dots, a_n): a_i \in A, i = 1, \dots, n\}
$$

This is a handy construction, for example, in representing:

-   $n$-dimensional real space ($\mathbb{R}^n$)
-   an $n$-dimensional unit cube ($[0, 1]^n$)
-   32-bit integers ($\{0, 1\}^{32}$)

### Cardinality

The [cardinality]{style="color: blue"} of a set is the number of elements it contains, and is written $|A|$. We say that:

-   $A$ is [finite]{style="color: blue"} if $|A| < \infty$
-   $A$ is [countable]{style="color: blue"} if $|A| = |\mathbb{N}|$
-   $A$ is [uncountable]{style="color: blue"} if $|A| > |\mathbb{N}|$

The power set of $A$ is the set of all subsets of $A$, and is written:

$$
2^A = \{B: B \subseteq A\}
$$

If $A$ is finite, $|2^A| = 2^{|A|}$; otherwise, $2^A$ is uncountable. We'll prove the finite case in class.

### Sequences of sets

Consider a sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \dots$. For short, we write the sequence $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ or simply $\{A_i\}$, where the index set is implicit from context.

Define the union/intersection of the first $n$ sets as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = \{x: x \in A_i \text{ for some } i \leq n\} \\
\bigcap_{i = 1}^n A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n = \{x: x \in A_i \text{ for every } i \leq n\}
\end{align*}
$$

Slightly more generally, one might define the union of a subcollection as $\bigcup_{j \in J} A_j$ for some collection of indices in the index set $J \subset \mathbb{N}$.

Now, if the sequence is infinite, the union or intersection of *all* sets in the sequence is defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty A_n = \{x: x \in A_i \text{ for some } i \in \mathbb{N} \} \\
\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty A_n = \{x: x \in A_i \text{ for every } i \in \mathbb{N}\}
\end{align*}
$$

These are referred to as [countable unions]{style="color: blue"} and [countable intersections]{style="color: blue"}.

We say that a sequence is [monotone]{style="color: blue"} if sets are sequentially nested, and more specifically, that the sequence is:

-   [nondecreasing]{style="color: blue"} if $A_i \subseteq A_{i + 1}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$
-   [increasing]{style="color: blue"} if $A_i \subset A_{i + 1}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$
-   [nonincreasing]{style="color: blue"} if $A_i \supseteq A_{i + 1}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$
-   [decreasing]{style="color: blue"} if $A_i \supset A_{i + 1}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$

Note that increasing sequences are also nondecreasing, and that decreasing sequences are also nonincreasing. We define the [limit]{style="color: blue"} of a monotone sequence of sets as the countable union or intersection:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} A_n = \bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty A_n \quad\text{(nonincreasing)} \\
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} A_n = \bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty A_n \quad\text{(nondecreasing)}
\end{align*}
$$

### The Cantor set

The [Cantor set]{style="color:blue"} is a subset of the unit interval with the counterintuitive distinction of having uncountably many points, but zero length. It is formed by recursively removing middle thirds, first from the unit interval, and then from each subinterval. This process is illustrated by the picture below.

![Recursively removing middle thirds.](img/cantor-set.png){width="5in"}

Each row represents a set consisting of the union of the shaded intervals, so we are considering a sequence of sets $\{C_n\}$ where:

$$
\begin{align*}
C_0 &= [0, 1] \\
C_1 &= \left[0, \frac{1}{3}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{3}, 1\right] \\
C_2 &= \left\{\left[0, \frac{1}{9}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{9}, \frac{1}{3}\right]\right\} \cup \left\{\left[\frac{2}{3}, \frac{7}{9}\right] \cup \left[\frac{8}{9}, 1\right]\right\} \\
&\vdots
\end{align*}
$$ One way to write the recursion explicitly at an arbitrary step $n$ is to consider the left endpoints $a_i^{(n - 1)}$ of the intervals from the previous step in the recursion and express the $n$th step as:

$$
C_n = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{2^{n - 1}} \left\{ 3^{-n} \left([0, 1]\cup[2, 3]\right) + a_i^{(n - 1)} \right\}
$$

(In this expression, $c\times[a, b] + d$ is shorthand for $[ca + d, cb + d]$ and $\times, +$ distribute over unions.)

Note that the sequence $\{C_n\}$ is monotonic and strictly [decreasing]{style="color:blue"}. The Cantor set is defined as the limit of this sequence:

$$
C^* = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} C_n = \bigcap_{n = 0}^\infty C_n
$$

The total length of any of the sets in the sequence is the sum of the lengths of the component intervals. The component intervals all have the same length $3^{-n}$, so:

$$
\text{length}(C_n) = \sum_{i = 1}^{2^n} 3^{-n} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n 
\longrightarrow 0 \quad
\text{ as } \quad n \rightarrow \infty
$$

Although it requires proof that $\text{length}(\lim_n C_n) = \lim_n \text{length}(C_n)$, this should seem plausible. (We will prove this result a little later.) Thus, then Cantor set has zero total length:

$$
\text{length}(C^*) = \text{length}\left(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} C_n\right) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\text{length}(C_n) = 0
$$

For this reason, and also because the set is expressed as a limit of a sequence of countable unions, one would expect that $C^*$ is countable. But in fact one can construct a one-to-one correspondence between the points in $C^*$ and the points in the unit interval $[0, 1]$. (The trick is to observe that the ternary (base-3) decimal representation of any point in $C^*$ only utilizes two unique digits and can thus be mapped to a binary decimal representation of a point in the unit interval in a way that is obviously bijective.) This establishes that $|C^*| = |[0, 1]|$ --- there are exactly the same number of points in the Cantor set and the unit interval --- and therefore that the Cantor set is uncountable!
