### Sample spaces and events

Consider an experiment or random process and define the [sample space]{style="color: blue"} to be:

$$
S: \text{ set of all possible outcomes}
$$
An [event]{style="color:blue"} is a subset $E \subseteq S$. Its [complement]{style="color:blue"} is defined as the set $E^C = S\setminus E$.

Note that $\left(E^C\right)^C = E$

It is immediate from previous results that, given any events $A, B$:

$$
(A\cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
(A\cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C
$$
Recursive application of this property yields [DeMorgan's laws]{style="color:blue"}:

$$
\left[\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i\right]^C = \bigcap A_i^c
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\left[\bigcap_{i = 1}^n A_i\right]^C = \bigcup A_i^c
$$

The proof is by induction, and left as an exercise. The base case is already established. For the inductive step, one need only reapply the base case replacing $A$ by $\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i$ and $B$ by $A_{n + 1}$.

### Disjoint events

Two events $E_1, E_2 \subseteq S$ are [disjoint]{style="color:blue"} just in case they share no outcomes, that is, if $E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$. 

A collection of events $\{E_i\}$ is [mutually disjoint]{style="color:blue"} just in case every pair is disjoint, that is, if:

$$
E_i \cap E_j = \emptyset 
\quad\text{for all}\quad
i \neq j
$$

A [partition]{style="color:blue"} is a mutually disjoint collection whose union contains an event of interest. Usually, one speaks of a partition of the sample space $S$, *i.e.*, a collection $\{E_i\}$ such that:

- $\{E_i\}$ are mutually disjoint events
- $\bigcup_i E_i = S$

### Probability spaces

Given a sample space $S$, denote by $\mathcal{S}$ the [set of all events]{style="color:blue"}. We will assume that this set:

- contains the empty set: $\emptyset \in \mathcal{S}$
- contains the sample space: $S \in \mathcal{S}$
- is closed under complements: $E \in \mathcal{S} \Longrightarrow E^C \in \mathcal{S}$
- is closed under countable unions: $E_i \in \mathcal{S} \Longrightarrow \bigcup_i E_i \in \mathcal{S}$

(Technically, such a collection is known as a "$\sigma$-algebra" of sets. These can be generated in a variety of ways; we won't go into the details here. Broadly, this construction is used to obtain a subcollection of $2^S$ with some essential regularity properties.)

Now, a [probability measure]{style="color:blue"} is any set function $P: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ satisfying three axioms:

1. $P(E) \geq 0$ for every $E\in \mathcal{S}$
2. $P(S) = 1$
3. If $\{E_n\}$ is a mutually disjoint sequence of events then
$$
P\left(\bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty E_n\right) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty P(E_n)
$$
In words, a probability is a *countably additive and nonnegative set function such that the probability of the sample space is 1*.

Finally, a [probability space]{style="color:blue"} is a triple $(S, \mathcal{S}, P)$ where:

- (sample space) $S$ is a set
- (collection of events) $\mathcal{S} \subseteq 2^S$ is a $\sigma$-algebra
- (probability) $P$ is a probability measure

### A simple probability space

Consider a coin toss with two outcomes, $H, T$. The sample space and collection of events are fairly straightforward:

$$
\begin{align*}
S = \{H, T\} \\
\mathcal{S} = \{\emptyset, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H, T\}\}
\end{align*}
$$

Discussion questions:

1. How should we interpret the events $\emptyset$ and $\{H, T\}$?
2. What are the valid probability measures in this case?
