Probability axioms, combinatorial methods, conditional and marginal probability, independence, random variables, univariate and multivariate probability distributions, conditional distributions, transformations, order statistics, expectation and variance. Use of statistical simulation throughout the course. 4 lectures. Prerequisite: MATH 241; MATH 248 or CSC 348; and STAT 305. Recommended: STAT 301.\n\n\nTextbook and references\nThere is no required textbook for the course. Readings, lecture, and the overall course organization will closely follow chapters 1 through 4 of DeGroot & Schervish. Students interested in a more formal exposition of this material are referred to Hogg & Craig.\n\n(recommended) DeGroot & Schervish, Probability and Statistics, 4th edition, Addison-Wesley.\n(optional) Hogg, McKean, & Craig, Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, 8th edition, Pearson.\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nSuccessful students will:\n\nuse the axiomatic construction of probability to derive properties of probability measures and conditional probability measures, and apply definitions and properties to solve probability problems \nconstruct probability models for discrete and continuous random variables, develop familiarity with common probability distributions, and use distribution functions to derive properties such as expectations and variances \ndetermine joint distributions for collections of random variables, and use joint distribution functions to (a) derive properties such as covariance and correlation, (b) to determine conditional and marginal distributions, and (c) derive distributions of transformations and functions of one or more random variables \n\n\n\nAssignments and assessments\nAttainment of learning outcomes will be measured by evaluation of submitted homework assignments and exams. Letter grades will be assigned based on a weighted average of scores, with the relative weighting approximately as follows:\n\nHomeworks (60%)\nMidterm (20%)\nFinal (20%)\n\nScores will be recorded in Canvas. Please note that letter grades are qualitative assessments of attainment of course objectives based on submitted work. The letter grade definitions do not include specific percentages of total points earned.\n\n\nTentative schedule\nSubject to change at instructor discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nLecture Topic\nReading\nAssignment\n\n\n\n\n0 (9/21)\nCourse introduction\n\n\n\n\n1 (9/25)\nProbability axioms and properties\n1.4‚Äì1.6\nHW1\n\n\n2 (10/2)\nCounting methods\n1.7‚Äì1.10\nHW2\n\n\n3 (10/9)\nConditional probability and independence\n2.1‚Äì2.2\nHW3\n\n\n4 (10/16)\nBayes‚Äô theorem\n2.3‚Äì2.4\nHW4\n\n\n5 (10/23)\nDiscrete and continuous random variables\n3.1‚Äì3.3\nMidterm\n\n\n6 (10/30)\nJoint and conditional distributions\n3.4‚Äì3.7\nHW5\n\n\n7 (11/6)\nTransformations and order statistics\n3.8‚Äì3.9\nHW6\n\n\n8 (11/13)\nExpectation\n4.1‚Äì4.2\nHW7\n\n\nFall break (11/20)\n\n\n\n\n\n9 (11/27)\nVariance and covariance\n4.3, 4.6\nHW8\n\n\n10 (12/4)\nConditional expectation\n4.7\n\n\n\nFinals (12/11)\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse policies\n\nAttendance\nRegular attendance is essential for success in the course and required per University policy. Each student may miss one class meeting without notice but subsequent absences should be excusable (see policy for what counts as ‚Äòexcusable‚Äô). This expectation will be enacted by honor system; and although roll will not be taken each class, unexcused absences may negatively impact course grades.\n\n\nCommunication and email\nStudents are encouraged to use face-to-face means of communication (office hours, class meetings, appointments) whenever possible. Email communication may be used on a secondary basis or when a written record of communication is needed. Every effort is made to respond to email within 48 weekday hours ‚Äî so a message sent Thursday or Friday may not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday. If a response is not received within one week, students should send a reminder.\n\n\nTime commitment\nSTAT425 is a four-credit course, which corresponds to a minimum time commitment of 12 hours per week, including lectures, reading, homework assignments, and study time. Some variability in workload by week should be expected, and most students may need to budget a few extra hours each week. However, students can expect to be able to meet course expectations with a time commitment less than 16 hours per week, and are encouraged to notify the instructor if they are regularly exceeding this amount.\n\n\nAssignment scores and final grades\nEvery effort will be made to provide consistent and fair evaluation of student work. Students should notify the instructor of any errors and/or discrepancies in evaluation promptly and on an assignment-by-assignment basis (i.e., not at the end of the quarter) to guarantee consideration for correction. Final grades will only be changed in the case of clerical errors. Negotiating scores or final grades is not appropriate. Per University policy, faculty have final responsibility for grading criteria and grading judgment and have the right to alter student assessment or other parts of the syllabus during the term. If any student feels their grade is unfairly assigned at the end of the course, they have the right to appeal it according to the procedure outlined here.\n\n\nLate work\nEach student may turn in one assignment up to one week late without penalty at any time during the quarter and without notice. Subsequently, assignments turned in up to one week late will be evaluated for 75% credit unless an extension is granted in advance. No late work will be accepted beyond one week after the original due date.\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Accommodation requests should be made through the Disability Resource Center.\n\n\nConduct and Academic Integrity\nStudents are expected to be aware of and adhere to University policy regarding academic integrity and conduct. Detailed information on these policies, and potential repercussions of policy violations, can be found via the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities."
