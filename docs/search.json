    "text": "Course information\nInstructor: Trevor Ruiz (he/him/his) [email]\nClass meetings:\n\n[Section 01/3585] 4:10pm – 5:00pm MTWR Construction Innovations Center Room C201\n[Section 02/3430] 5:10pm – 6:00pm MTWR Construction Innovations Center Room C201\n\nOffice hours: 2:00pm – 3:00pm TWR 25-236 and by appointment\nProbability is the mathematics of random events. It is an active field of study and provides the theoretical foundation for the discipline of statistics. This course aims to formalize familiar probability concepts covered in prior coursework (predominantly STAT 305), including probability rules, random variables, common distributions, and expected value. We will build on prior experience and intuition and develop tools to support deeper inquiry and subsequent study of mathematical statistics in STAT 426 and STAT 427. Students will also be introduced to potentially new concepts that play central roles in statistics such as joint distributions, transformations, and conditional expectation. Lectures will provide an exposition of definitions, properties, theorems, and examples, and offer a venue for discussion; students will practice applying this material to solve probability problems on homework assignments and demonstrate fluency with key concepts on in-class exams.\n\n\nCatalog Description\nRigorous development of probability theory. Probability axioms, combinatorial methods, conditional and marginal probability, independence, random variables, univariate and multivariate probability distributions, conditional distributions, transformations, order statistics, expectation and variance. Use of statistical simulation throughout the course. 4 lectures. Prerequisite: MATH 241; MATH 248 or CSC 348; and STAT 305. Recommended: STAT 301.\n\n\nTextbook and references\nThere is no required textbook for the course. However, the overall course organization will closely follow chapters 1 through 4 of DeGroot & Schervish, and exposition of this material will follow Hogg & Craig, which is slightly more formal in style. These books are listed below.\n\n(recommended) DeGroot & Schervish, Probability and Statistics, 4th edition, Addison-Wesley.\n(reference) Hogg, McKean, & Craig, Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, 8th edition, Pearson.\n\nDesk copies of DeGroot & Schervish are available in StatLab (25-107B).\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nThe course aims to enable students to:\n\nuse the axiomatic construction of probability to derive properties of probability measures and conditional probability measures, and apply definitions and properties to solve probability problems \nconstruct probability models for discrete and continuous random variables, develop familiarity with common probability distributions, and use distribution functions to derive properties such as expectations and variances \ndetermine joint distributions for collections of random variables, and use joint distribution functions to (a) derive properties such as covariance and correlation, (b) to determine conditional and marginal distributions, and (c) derive distributions of transformations and functions of one or more random variables \n\n\n\nAssessments\nAttainment of learning outcomes will be measured by evaluation of submitted homework assignments and exams. Letter grades will be assigned based on a weighted average of scores, with the relative weighting approximately as indicated in parentheses below.\n\nHomeworks (50%). Homework assignments will be given approximately weekly (except for exam weeks and holidays). The goal of homework assignments is to provide opportunities for students to reinforce key concepts, definitions, and results through practice and to develop and apply problem-solving abilities. These will be distributed on Thursday each week in which they are assigned and due in class the following Thursday; in general, each assignment will consist of questions pertaining to material discussed in class during the preceding week. Students are encouraged to collaborate on homework assignments, but are expected to prepare submissions individually and indicate in writing on their submission any classmates they collaborated with (see collaboration policy below). Submissions should reflect students’ best effort and will be evaluated based on completeness, organization, and correctness of selected answers. Each student’s lowest homework score will be omitted in grade calculations; otherwise, all homework scores will be weighted equally.\nMidterms (30%). Two midterm exams will be given during the quarter at approximately four-week intervals as shown on the tentative schedule below. The goal of the midterm exams is to assess students’ ability to use key concepts, definitions, and results in furtherance of course learning outcomes. Midterms will be given in class on Thursdays during indicated weeks and consist of 2-3 questions that must be answered individually during the allotted time without consulting anyone except the instructor. Students will be allowed one sheet of notes that they may consult while taking each exam. Answers will be evaluated based on completeness and correctness. While both midterm exams will count towards final grades, whichever exam receives the higher score will be weighted more heavily in grade calculations.\nFinal (20%). A final exam will be given in the usual classroom at the time scheduled by the registrar. The goal of the final exam is to assess students’ integration of the course material in furtherance of course learning oucomes. For Section 01, the final will be held on Wednesday, December 13, 4:10pm — 7:00pm; for Section 02, the final will be held on Friday, December 15, 4:10pm — 7:00pm. The final will consist of 4-6 questions that must be answered individually during the allotted time without consulting anyone except the instructor. Students will be allowed one sheet of notes that they may consult while taking the final. Its scope will be cumulative but emphasis will be on later material. Answers will be evaluated based on completeness and correctness.\n\nEvery effort will be made to return evaluated work within one week of submission. Final exams, per University policy, will be retained by the instructor. Scores will be recorded in Canvas, and students will be responsible for checking their scores to ensure accurate data entry upon receipt of evaluated work.\nVery roughly, letter grades will be assigned as follows. A: 90-100. B: 75-90. C: 60-75. D: 50-60. However, please note that letter grades represent qualitative assessments of attainment of course objectives, and as such these ranges may be adjusted at instructor discretion to ensure apporpriate correspondence with letter grade definitions based on course assessments. Please also note that failure to adhere to course policies — particularly collaboration, academic integrity, and attendance policies — may result in a lower letter grade than would otherwise be assigned.\n\n\nTentative schedule\nSubject to change at instructor discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nLecture Topic\nSuggested reading\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n0 (9/21)\nCourse introduction\n\n\n\n\n1 (9/25)\nProbability axioms and properties\n1.4–1.6\nHW1\n\n\n2 (10/2)\nCounting methods\n1.7–1.10\nHW2\n\n\n3 (10/9)\nConditional probability and independence\n2.1–2.2\nHW3\n\n\n4 (10/16)\nBayes’ theorem\n2.3–2.4\nMidterm 1\n\n\n5 (10/23)\nDiscrete and continuous random variables\n3.1–3.3\nHW4\n\n\n6 (10/30)\nJoint and conditional distributions\n3.4–3.7\nHW5\n\n\n7 (11/6)\nTransformations and order statistics\n3.8–3.9\nHW6\n\n\n8 (11/13)\nExpectation\n4.1–4.2\nMidterm 2\n\n\nFall break (11/20)\n\n\n\n\n\n9 (11/27)\nVariance and covariance\n4.3, 4.6\nHW7\n\n\n10 (12/4)\nConditional expectation\n4.7\n\n\n\nFinals (12/11)\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse policies\n\nCollaboration\nCollaboration within the class (including across class sections) is allowed (and encouraged!) on homework assignments, subject to certain conditions outlined in the paragraph below. Collaboration does not include consulting individuals outside of the class. Students collaborating with a group are expected to prepare their own solutions, in their own words and writing, and are required to indicate their collaborators in writing on their submission. Submissions that do not indicate any collaborators will be understood to represent the sole and independent effort of the student named on the submission.\nA collaboration is a shared effort. Students that choose to work together on homework assignments are expected to make material contributions towards producing one or more shared answers or solutions. Material contributions might include participation in discussions, critique of a proposed solution, or presentation of a problem approach. In the absence of such contributions, submitting shared answers is not appropriate and, depending on the circumstances, may constitute an act of dishonesty. The best way to ensure that a group effort is consistent with this collaboration policy is to agree that all team members will attempt all or most of each assignment individually prior to engaging in any discussions.\n\n\nAttendance\nRegular attendance is essential for success in the course and required per University policy. Each student may miss two class meetings without notice but subsequent absences should be excusable and students should notify the instructor. Unexcused absences may negatively impact course grades.\n\n\nCommunication and email\nStudents are encouraged to use face-to-face means of communication (office hours, class meetings, appointments) when possible. Email may be used on a secondary basis or when a written record of communication is needed. Every effort is made to respond to email within 48 weekday hours — so a message sent Thursday or Friday may not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday. Time-sensitive messages should be identified as such in the subject line. Students should wait one week before sending a reminder.\n\n\nTime commitment\nSTAT425 is a four-credit course, which corresponds to a minimum time commitment of 12 hours per week, including lectures, reading, homework assignments, and study time. Some variability in workload by week should be expected, and most students will need to budget a few extra hours each week. However, students can expect to be able to meet course expectations with a time commitment less than 16 hours per week, and are encouraged to notify the instructor if they are regularly exceeding this amount.\n\n\nAssignment scores and final grades\nEvery effort will be made to provide consistent and fair evaluation of student work. Students should notify the instructor of any errors and/or discrepancies in evaluation promptly and on an assignment-by-assignment basis (i.e., not at the end of the quarter) to guarantee consideration for correction. Final grades will only be changed in the case of clerical errors. Attempting to negotiate scores or final grades is not appropriate. Per University policy, faculty have final responsibility for grading criteria and grading judgment and have the right to alter student assessment or other parts of the syllabus during the term. If any student feels their grade is unfairly assigned at the end of the course, they have the right to appeal it according to the procedure outlined here.\n\n\nLate work\nEach student may turn in two homework assignments up to one week late without penalty at any time during the quarter and without notice. Subsequently, assignments turned in up to one week late will be evaluated for 75% credit unless an extension is granted in advance. No late work will be accepted beyond one week after the original due date. This policy applies to homework assignments only, and not exams.\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Accommodation requests should be made through the Disability Resource Center (DRC).\n\n\nConduct and Academic Integrity\nStudents are expected to be aware of and adhere to University policy regarding academic integrity and conduct. Detailed information on these policies, and potential repercussions of policy violations, can be found via the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities (OSRR).\n\n\nCopyright and distribution of course materials\nAll course materials, including handouts, homework assignments, study guides, course notes, exams, and solutions are subject to copyright; students are not permitted to share or distribute any course materials without the explicit written consent of the instructor. This includes, in particular, uploading materials or prepared solutions to online services and sharing materials or prepared solutions with students who may take the course in a future term. Transgressions of this policy compromise the effectiveness of course assessments and do a disservice to future students."

    "text": "Concepts\nA set is a collection of mathematical objects such as numbers, points, functions, or more sets.\nIf an object \\(x\\) is in a set \\(A\\), we say that \\(x\\) is an element of \\(A\\) and write \\(x \\in A\\) to mean “\\(x\\) is in \\(A\\)”. Otherwise, we write \\(x \\not\\in A\\).\nWe write a set by identifying its elements. For example:\n\\[\nA =\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\n\\]\nTwo sets \\(A, B\\) are identical just in case they have exactly the same elements:\n\\[\nA = B\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\nx \\in A \\Leftrightarrow x \\in B\n\\]\n\n\nSpecial sets\nThere are some special notations for the sets of numbers:\n\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\): real numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\): natural numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\): integers\n\\(\\mathbb{C}\\): complex numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\): rational numbers\n\nSimilarly, open, closed, and half-open real intervals are denoted:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n[a, b] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: a \\leq x \\leq b\\} \\\\\n(a, b] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: a &lt; x \\leq b\\} \\\\\n[a, b) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: a \\leq x &lt; b\\} \\\\\n(a, b) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: a &lt; x &lt; b\\}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nContainment\nIf all the elements of a set \\(A\\) are also in \\(B\\), then we say that \\(A\\) is contained in \\(B\\), or that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), and write \\(A \\subseteq B\\). (Containment is a binary relation and defines a partial ordering on the set of all sets.)\n\\[\nA \\subseteq B\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\nx \\in A \\Rightarrow x \\in B\n\\]\nFurther, \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(B\\) just in case there is at least one element of \\(B\\) that is not in \\(A\\):\n\\[\nA \\subset B\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\nA \\subseteq B \\text{ and } A \\neq B\n\\]\nBoth relations are transitive:\n\nIf \\(A \\subseteq B\\) and \\(B \\subseteq C\\) then \\(A \\subseteq C\\)\nIf \\(A \\subset B\\) and \\(B \\subset C\\) then \\(A \\subset C\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(A = [0, 1)\\) and \\(B = (0, 1]\\) and \\(C = (0, 2)\\)\n\nTrue or false, \\(A \\subset C\\)\nTrue or false, \\(B \\subset C\\)\n\nList all proper subset relations among \\(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{Q}, \\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{C}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nNull set\nLastly it may happen that a set contains no elements. This set is called the null set (or empty set) and is denoted \\(\\emptyset = \\{ \\}\\).\nFor a small brain teaser, prove that every set contains the null set: for any set \\(A\\), \\(\\emptyset \\subseteq A\\). Intuitively, this is true; but why, based on the definitions, must it hold? (Hint: the conditional “if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)” is trivially true if \\(p\\) is always false.)\n\n\nSet operations\nThe two fundamental set operations are union and intersection. Let \\(A, B\\) be sets and define:\n\n(union) \\(A \\cup B = \\{x: x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}\\)\n(intersection) \\(A \\cap B = \\{x: x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}\\)\n\nBoth operations are associative:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA \\cup (B \\cup C) = (A \\cup B) \\cup C \\\\\nA \\cap (B \\cap C) = (A \\cap B) \\cap C\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAnd distributive:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C) \\\\\nA \\cap (B \\cup C) = (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nProofs are direct and left as an exercise: apply definitions of union/intersection and show that the conditions specified by each construction are equivalent. The properties follow, essentially, from the meanings of “and” and “or”.\nThe operation of set difference corresponds to removing the elements of one set from another set:\n\\[\nA \\setminus B = \\{x: x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\not\\in B\\}\n\\]\nSet difference is not distributive over unions and intersections, but rather exhibits the following properties:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA \\setminus (B \\cap C) = (A \\setminus B) \\cup (A \\setminus C) \\\\\nA \\setminus (B \\cup C) = (A \\setminus B) \\cap (A \\setminus C)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe’ll review the proof in class.\nLastly, the Cartesian product between sets is the set of all possible pairs of elements from each set:\n\\[\nA \\times B = \\{(a, b): a \\in A, b \\in B\\}\n\\]\nThe \\(n\\)-fold product of a set \\(A\\) with itself is written \\(A^n\\):\n\\[\nA^n = \\{(a_1, \\dots, a_n): a_i \\in A, i = 1, \\dots, n\\}\n\\]\nThis is a handy construction, for example, in representing:\n\n\\(n\\)-dimensional real space (\\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\))\nan \\(n\\)-dimensional unit cube (\\([0, 1]^n\\))\n32-bit integers (\\(\\{0, 1\\}^{32}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(A = [0, 1)\\) and \\(B = (0, 1]\\) and write the following sets as real intervals.\n\n\\(A \\cup B\\)\n\\(A \\cap B\\)\n\\(B\\setminus A\\)\n\\((A \\cup B) \\setminus (A \\cap B)\\)\n\\((A \\cap B) \\setminus (A \\cup B)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinality\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements it contains, and is written \\(|A|\\). We say that:\n\n\\(A\\) is finite if \\(|A| &lt; \\infty\\)\n\\(A\\) is countable if \\(|A| = |\\mathbb{N}|\\)\n\\(A\\) is uncountable if \\(|A| &gt; |\\mathbb{N}|\\)\n\nThe power set of \\(A\\) is the set of all subsets of \\(A\\), and is written:\n\\[\n2^A = \\{B: B \\subseteq A\\}\n\\]\nIf \\(A\\) is finite, \\(|2^A| = 2^{|A|}\\); otherwise, \\(2^A\\) is uncountable. We’ll prove the finite case in class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(A = \\{0, 6, 12, 44, 190\\}\\), what is \\(|A|\\)?\nIf \\(A = \\{H, T\\}\\), list all the elements of \\(2^A\\).\nIf \\(A = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: x \\leq 100 \\text{ and } x\\%2 = 0\\}\\), find \\(|A|\\) and \\(|2^A|\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nSequences of sets\nConsider a sequence of sets \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\). For short, we write the sequence \\(\\{A_i\\}_{i \\in I}\\) or simply \\(\\{A_i\\}\\), where the index set is implicit from context.\nDefine the union/intersection of the first \\(n\\) sets as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n = \\{x: x \\in A_i \\text{ for some } i \\leq n\\} \\\\\n\\bigcap_{i = 1}^n A_i = A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n = \\{x: x \\in A_i \\text{ for every } i \\leq n\\}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSlightly more generally, one might define the union of a subcollection as \\(\\bigcup_{j \\in J} A_j\\) for some collection of indices in the index set \\(J \\subset \\mathbb{N}\\).\nNow, if the sequence is infinite, the union or intersection of all sets in the sequence is defined as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bigcup_{n = 1}^\\infty A_n = \\{x: x \\in A_i \\text{ for some } i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\\\\n\\bigcap_{n = 1}^\\infty A_n = \\{x: x \\in A_i \\text{ for every } i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThese are referred to as countable unions and countable intersections.\nWe say that a sequence is monotone if sets are sequentially nested, and more specifically, that the sequence is:\n\nnondecreasing if \\(A_i \\subseteq A_{i + 1}\\) for every \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\)\nincreasing if \\(A_i \\subset A_{i + 1}\\) for every \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\)\nnonincreasing if \\(A_i \\supseteq A_{i + 1}\\) for every \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\)\ndecreasing if \\(A_i \\supset A_{i + 1}\\) for every \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\)\n\nNote that increasing sequences are also nondecreasing, and that decreasing sequences are also nonincreasing. We define the limit of a monotone sequence of sets as the countable union or intersection:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} A_n = \\bigcap_{n = 1}^\\infty A_n \\quad\\text{(nonincreasing)} \\\\\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} A_n = \\bigcup_{n = 1}^\\infty A_n \\quad\\text{(nondecreasing)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\{A_n\\}\\) is a nondecreasing sequence, what is \\(\\bigcap_{n = 1}^\\infty A_n\\)?\nIf \\(\\{A_n\\}\\) is a nonincreasing sequence, what is \\(\\bigcup_{n = 1}^\\infty A_n\\)?\nIf \\(\\{A_n\\}\\) is a decreasing sequence, what is \\(\\bigcap_{i = 1}^n A_i\\)?\nIf \\(\\{A_n\\}\\) is a decreasing sequence, what is \\(\\bigcap_{n = 1}^\\infty A_n\\)?\nIf \\(\\{A_n\\}\\) is an increasing sequence, what is \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cantor set\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the unit interval with the counterintuitive distinction of having uncountably many points, but zero length. It is formed by recursively removing middle thirds, first from the unit interval, and then from each subinterval. This process is illustrated by the picture below.\n\n\n\nRecursively removing middle thirds.\n\n\nEach row represents a set consisting of the union of the shaded intervals, so we are considering a sequence of sets \\(\\{C_n\\}\\) where:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nC_0 &= [0, 1] \\\\\nC_1 &= \\left[0, \\frac{1}{3}\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{2}{3}, 1\\right] \\\\\nC_2 &= \\left\\{\\left[0, \\frac{1}{9}\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{2}{9}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right]\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{\\left[\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{7}{9}\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{8}{9}, 1\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\] One way to write the recursion explicitly at an arbitrary step \\(n\\) is to consider the left endpoints \\(a_i^{(n - 1)}\\) of the intervals from the previous step in the recursion and express the \\(n\\)th step as:\n\\[\nC_n = \\bigcup_{i = 1}^{2^{n - 1}} \\left\\{ 3^{-n} \\left([0, 1]\\cup[2, 3]\\right) + a_i^{(n - 1)} \\right\\}\n\\]\n(In this expression, \\(c\\times[a, b] + d\\) is shorthand for \\([ca + d, cb + d]\\) and \\(\\times, +\\) distribute over unions.)\nNote that the sequence \\(\\{C_n\\}\\) is monotonic and strictly decreasing. The Cantor set is defined as the limit of this sequence:\n\\[\nC^* = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} C_n = \\bigcap_{n = 0}^\\infty C_n\n\\]\nThe total length of any of the sets in the sequence is the sum of the lengths of the component intervals. The component intervals all have the same length \\(3^{-n}\\), so:\n\\[\n\\text{length}(C_n) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{2^n} 3^{-n} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n\n\\longrightarrow 0 \\quad\n\\text{ as } \\quad n \\rightarrow \\infty\n\\]\nAlthough it requires proof that \\(\\text{length}(\\lim_n C_n) = \\lim_n \\text{length}(C_n)\\), this should seem plausible. (We will prove this result a little later.) Thus, then Cantor set has zero total length:\n\\[\n\\text{length}(C^*) = \\text{length}\\left(\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} C_n\\right) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\text{length}(C_n) = 0\n\\]\nFor this reason, and also because the set is expressed as a limit of a sequence of countable unions, one would expect that \\(C^*\\) is countable. But in fact one can construct a one-to-one correspondence between the points in \\(C^*\\) and the points in the unit interval \\([0, 1]\\). (The trick is to observe that the ternary (base-3) decimal representation of any point in \\(C^*\\) only utilizes two unique digits and can thus be mapped to a binary decimal representation of a point in the unit interval in a way that is obviously bijective.) This establishes that \\(|C^*| = |[0, 1]|\\) — there are exactly the same number of points in the Cantor set and the unit interval — and therefore that the Cantor set is uncountable!"

    "text": "Sample spaces and events\nConsider an experiment or random process and define the sample space to be:\n\\[\nS: \\text{ set of all possible outcomes}\n\\] An event is a subset \\(E \\subseteq S\\). Its complement is defined as the set \\(E^C = S\\setminus E\\).\nNote that \\(\\left(E^C\\right)^C = E\\)\nIt is immediate from previous results that, given any events \\(A, B\\):\n\\[\n(A\\cup B)^C = A^C \\cap B^C\n\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\n(A\\cap B)^C = A^C \\cup B^C\n\\] Recursive application of this property yields DeMorgan’s laws:\n\\[\n\\left[\\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i\\right]^C = \\bigcap A_i^c\n\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\n\\left[\\bigcap_{i = 1}^n A_i\\right]^C = \\bigcup A_i^c\n\\]\nThe proof is by induction, and left as an exercise. The base case is already established. For the inductive step, one need only reapply the base case replacing \\(A\\) by \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i\\) and \\(B\\) by \\(A_{n + 1}\\).\n\n\nDisjoint events\nTwo events \\(E_1, E_2 \\subseteq S\\) are disjoint just in case they share no outcomes, that is, if \\(E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset\\).\nA collection of events \\(\\{E_i\\}\\) is mutually disjoint just in case every pair is disjoint, that is, if:\n\\[\nE_i \\cap E_j = \\emptyset\n\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad\ni \\neq j\n\\]\nA partition is a mutually disjoint collection whose union contains an event of interest. Usually, one speaks of a partition of the sample space \\(S\\), i.e., a collection \\(\\{E_i\\}\\) such that:\n\n\\(\\{E_i\\}\\) are mutually disjoint events\n\\(\\bigcup_i E_i = S\\)\n\n\n\nProbability spaces\nGiven a sample space \\(S\\), denote by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) the set of all events. We will assume that this set:\n\ncontains the empty set: \\(\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{S}\\)\ncontains the sample space: \\(S \\in \\mathcal{S}\\)\nis closed under complements: \\(E \\in \\mathcal{S} \\Longrightarrow E^C \\in \\mathcal{S}\\)\nis closed under countable unions: \\(E_i \\in \\mathcal{S} \\Longrightarrow \\bigcup_i E_i \\in \\mathcal{S}\\)\n\n(Technically, such a collection is known as a “\\(\\sigma\\)-algebra” of sets. These can be generated in a variety of ways; we won’t go into the details here. Broadly, this construction is used to obtain a subcollection of \\(2^S\\) with some essential regularity properties.)\nNow, a probability measure is any set function \\(P: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0, 1]\\) satisfying three axioms:\n\n\\(P(E) \\geq 0\\) for every \\(E\\in \\mathcal{S}\\)\n\\(P(S) = 1\\)\nIf \\(\\{E_n\\}\\) is a mutually disjoint sequence of events then \\[\nP\\left(\\bigcup_{n = 1}^\\infty E_n\\right) = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty P(E_n)\n\\] In words, a probability is a countably additive and nonnegative set function such that the probability of the sample space is 1.\n\nFinally, a probability space is a triple \\((S, \\mathcal{S}, P)\\) where:\n\n(sample space) \\(S\\) is a set\n(collection of events) \\(\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq 2^S\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra\n(probability) \\(P\\) is a probability measure\n\n\n\nA simple probability space\nConsider a coin toss with two outcomes, \\(H, T\\). The sample space and collection of events are fairly straightforward:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nS = \\{H, T\\} \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{H\\}, \\{T\\}, \\{H, T\\}\\}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nDiscussion questions:\n\nHow should we interpret the events \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{H, T\\}\\)?\nWhat are the valid probability measures in this case?"
