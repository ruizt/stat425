    "text": "Class information\nInstructor: Trevor Ruiz (he/him/his) [email]\nClass meetings:\n\n[Section 01/3585] 4:10pm – 5:00pm MTWR Construction Innovations Center Room C201\n[Section 02/3430] 5:10pm – 6:00pm MTWR Construction Innovations Center Room C201\n\nOffice hours: 2:00pm – 3:00pm TWR 25-236 and by appointment\n\n\nCatalog Description\nRigorous development of probability theory. Probability axioms, combinatorial methods, conditional and marginal probability, independence, random variables, univariate and multivariate probability distributions, conditional distributions, transformations, order statistics, expectation and variance. Use of statistical simulation throughout the course. 4 lectures. Prerequisite: MATH 241; MATH 248 or CSC 348; and STAT 305. Recommended: STAT 301.\n\n\nTextbook and references\nThere is no required textbook for the course. However, the overall course organization will closely follow chapters 1 through 4 of DeGroot & Schervish, and exposition of this material will follow Hogg & Craig, which is slightly more formal in style. These books are listed below.\n\n(recommended) DeGroot & Schervish, Probability and Statistics, 4th edition, Addison-Wesley.\n(reference) Hogg, McKean, & Craig, Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, 8th edition, Pearson.\n\nDesk copies of DeGroot & Schervish are available in StatLab (25-107B).\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nSuccessful students will:\n\nuse the axiomatic construction of probability to derive properties of probability measures and conditional probability measures, and apply definitions and properties to solve probability problems \nconstruct probability models for discrete and continuous random variables, develop familiarity with common probability distributions, and use distribution functions to derive properties such as expectations and variances \ndetermine joint distributions for collections of random variables, and use joint distribution functions to (a) derive properties such as covariance and correlation, (b) to determine conditional and marginal distributions, and (c) derive distributions of transformations and functions of one or more random variables \n\n\n\nAssessments\nAttainment of learning outcomes will be measured by evaluation of submitted homework assignments and exams. Letter grades will be assigned based on a weighted average of scores, with the relative weighting approximately as follows.\n\nHomeworks (50%). Homework assignments will be given approximately weekly (except for exam weeks and holidays). These will be distributed on Thursday each week in which they are assigned and due in class the following Thursday; in general, each assignment will consist of questions pertaining to material discussed in class during the preceding week. Students are encouraged to collaborate on homework assignments, but are expected to prepare submissions individually and indicate in writing on their submission any classmates they consulted. Submissions should reflect students’ best effort and will be evaluated based on completeness, organization, and correctness of selected answers. Each student’s lowest homework score will be omitted in grade calculations; otherwise, all homework scores will be weighted equally.\nMidterms (30%). Two midterm exams will be given during the quarter at approximately four-week intervals as shown on the tentative schedule below. Midterms will be given in class on Thursdays during indicated weeks and consist of 2-3 questions that must be answered individually during the allotted time without consulting anyone except the instructor. Answers will be evaluated based on completeness and correctness. The exam receiving the higher score will be weighted more heavily in grade calculations.\nFinal (20%). A final exam will be given in the usual classroom at the time scheduled by the registrar. For Section 01, the final will be held on Wednesday, December 13, 4:10pm — 7:00pm; for Section 02, the final will be held on Friday, December 15, 4:10pm — 7:00pm. The final will consist of 4-6 questions that must be answered individually during the allotted time without consulting anyone except the instructor. Its scope will be cumulative but emphasis will be on later material. Answers will be evaluated based on completeness and correctness.\n\nEvery effort will be made to return evaluated work within one week of submission. Final exams, per University policy, will be retained by the instructor. Scores will be recorded in Canvas, and students are responsible for checking their scores to ensure accurate data entry upon receipt of evaluated work.\nVery roughly, letter grades will be assigned as follows. A: 90-100. B: 75-90. C: 60-75. D: 50-60. However, please note that letter grades represent qualitative assessments of attainment of course objectives, and as such these ranges may be adjusted at instructor discretion to ensure correspondence with letter grade definitions based on submitted work. Please also note that failure to adhere to course policies — particularly collaboration, academic integrity, and attendance — may result in a lower letter grade than would otherwise be assigned.\n\n\nTentative schedule\nSubject to change at instructor discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nLecture Topic\nSuggested reading\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n0 (9/21)\nCourse introduction\n\n\n\n\n1 (9/25)\nProbability axioms and properties\n1.4–1.6\nHW1\n\n\n2 (10/2)\nCounting methods\n1.7–1.10\nHW2\n\n\n3 (10/9)\nConditional probability and independence\n2.1–2.2\nHW3\n\n\n4 (10/16)\nBayes’ theorem\n2.3–2.4\nMidterm 1\n\n\n5 (10/23)\nDiscrete and continuous random variables\n3.1–3.3\nHW4\n\n\n6 (10/30)\nJoint and conditional distributions\n3.4–3.7\nHW5\n\n\n7 (11/6)\nTransformations and order statistics\n3.8–3.9\nHW6\n\n\n8 (11/13)\nExpectation\n4.1–4.2\nMidterm 2\n\n\nFall break (11/20)\n\n\n\n\n\n9 (11/27)\nVariance and covariance\n4.3, 4.6\nHW7\n\n\n10 (12/4)\nConditional expectation\n4.7\n\n\n\nFinals (12/11)\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse policies\n\nCollaboration\nCollaboration within the class is both allowed and encouraged on homework assignments. Collaboration means that all parties make material contributions. Material contributions include participation in discussion, suggesting an approach or idea, providing consultation on a problem or difficulty, and presenting an approach. Collaboration does not include copying another student’s answer (even if it is during a group session), consulting with students or other individuals outside of the class, dividing an assignment among a group and exchanging answers, or ‘sitting in’ on a group work session.\nStudents collaborating with a group are expected to prepare their own solutions, in their own words and writing, and are required to indicate their collaborators in writing on their submission. Submissions that do not indicate any collaborators will be understood to represent the sole and independent effort of the student named on the submission.\nAny instances of unacknowledged exchange of work or obtaining of answers by inappropriate means will be regarded as plagiarism. The best way to ensure that a group effort is consistent with this collaboration policy is to require that all students attempt all problems before engaging in any discussion or exchange.\n\n\nAttendance\nRegular attendance is essential for success in the course and required per University policy. Each student may miss two class meetings without notice but subsequent absences should be excusable. This expectation will be enacted by honor system, and although attendance will not be taken each class meeting, unexcused absences may negatively impact course grades.\n\n\nCommunication and email\nStudents are encouraged to use face-to-face means of communication (office hours, class meetings, appointments) whenever possible. Email communication may be used on a secondary basis or when a written record of communication is needed. Every effort is made to respond to email within 48 weekday hours — so a message sent Thursday or Friday may not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday. If a response is not received within one week, students should send a reminder.\n\n\nTime commitment\nSTAT425 is a four-credit course, which corresponds to a minimum time commitment of 12 hours per week, including lectures, reading, homework assignments, and study time. Some variability in workload by week should be expected, and most students may need to budget a few extra hours each week. However, students can expect to be able to meet course expectations with a time commitment less than 16 hours per week, and are encouraged to notify the instructor if they are regularly exceeding this amount.\n\n\nAssignment scores and final grades\nEvery effort will be made to provide consistent and fair evaluation of student work. Students should notify the instructor of any errors and/or discrepancies in evaluation promptly and on an assignment-by-assignment basis (i.e., not at the end of the quarter) to guarantee consideration for correction. Final grades will only be changed in the case of clerical errors. Negotiating scores or final grades is not appropriate. Per University policy, faculty have final responsibility for grading criteria and grading judgment and have the right to alter student assessment or other parts of the syllabus during the term. If any student feels their grade is unfairly assigned at the end of the course, they have the right to appeal it according to the procedure outlined here.\n\n\nLate work\nEach student may turn in two homework assignments up to one week late without penalty at any time during the quarter and without notice. Subsequently, assignments turned in up to one week late will be evaluated for 75% credit unless an extension is granted in advance. No late work will be accepted beyond one week after the original due date. This policy applies to homeworks only, and not exams.\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Accommodation requests should be made through the Disability Resource Center (DRC).\n\n\nConduct and Academic Integrity\nStudents are expected to be aware of and adhere to University policy regarding academic integrity and conduct. Detailed information on these policies, and potential repercussions of policy violations, can be found via the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities (OSSR).\n\n\nCopyright and distribution of course materials\nAll course materials, including handouts, homework assignments, study guides, course notes, exams, and solutions are subject to copyright; students are not permitted to share or distribute any course materials without the explicit written consent of the instructor. This includes, in particular, uploading materials or prepared solutions to online services and sharing materials or prepared solutions with students who may take the course in a future term."
