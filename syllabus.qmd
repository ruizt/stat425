### Catalog Description

Rigorous development of probability theory. Probability axioms, combinatorial methods, conditional and marginal probability, independence, random variables, univariate and multivariate probability distributions, conditional distributions, transformations, order statistics, expectation and variance. Use of statistical simulation throughout the course. 4 lectures. Prerequisite: MATH 241; MATH 248 or CSC 348; and STAT 305. Recommended: STAT 301.

### Textbook and references

There is no required textbook for the course. Readings, lecture, and the overall course organization will closely follow chapters 1 through 4 of DeGroot & Schervish. Students interested in a more formal exposition of this material are referred to Hogg & Craig.

-   (recommended) DeGroot & Schervish, *Probability and Statistics*, 4th edition, Addison-Wesley.

-   (optional) Hogg, McKean, & Craig, *Introduction to Mathematical Statistics*, 8th edition, Pearson.

### Learning outcomes

Successful students will:

-   use the axiomatic construction of probability to derive properties of probability measures and conditional probability measures, and apply definitions and properties to solve probability problems <!-- CLO 1, 3; EO a -->

-   construct probability models for discrete and continuous random variables, develop familiarity with common probability distributions, and use distribution functions to derive properties such as expectations and variances <!-- CLO 2, 4, 5; EO b, c, e -->

-   determine joint distributions for collections of random variables, and use joint distribution functions to derive properties such as covariance and correlation and to determine conditional and marginal distributions and distributions of transformations <!-- CLO 6, 7; EO d, f -->

### Assignments and assessments

Attainment of learning outcomes will be measured by evaluation of submitted homework assignments and exams. Letter grades will be assigned based on a weighted average of scores, with the relative weighting approximately as follows:

-   Homeworks (60%)

-   Midterm (20%)

-   Final (20%)

Scores will be recorded in Canvas. Please note that letter grades are *qualitative* assessments of attainment of course objectives based on submitted work. The [letter grade definitions](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/academicstandardsandpolicies/grading/) do not include specific percentages of total points earned.

### Course policies

#### Attendance

Regular attendance is essential for success in the course and required per [university policy](https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/class-attendance). Each student may miss one class meeting without notice but subsequent absences should be excusable. This expectation will be enacted by honor system; and although roll will not be taken each class, unexcused absences may negatively impact course grades.

#### Communication

Students are encouraged to use face-to-face means of communication (office hours and class meetings) wherever possible, and email on a secondary basis or when a written record of communication is needed. Every effort is made to respond to email within 48 weekday hours --- so a message sent Thursday or Friday may not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday.

#### Time commitment

This is a four-credit course, which corresponds to a *minimum* time commitment of 12 hours per week, including lectures, reading, homework assignments, and study time. Some variability in workload by week should be expected, and most students may need to budget a few extra hours each week, but students should not exceed 16 hours weekly in order to meet course expectations. Students finding themselves exceeding this time commitment regularly should meet with the instructor to identify strategies for improving workload management.

#### Grades

Every effort will be made to ensure consistent and fair evaluation of student work. To that end, students should address any discrepancies on individual assignements with the instructor and/or grader promptly and no later than one week after return of the assignment in question. Negotiating scores is not appropriate. Per university policy, faculty have final responsibility for grading criteria and grading judgment and have the right to alter student assessment or other parts of the syllabus during the term. If any student feels their grade was unfairly assigned, they have the right to appeal it according to the procedure outlined [here](https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academic-petition-appeals).

#### Late work

Each student may turn in one assignment up to one week late without penalty at any time during the quarter. Subsequently, assignments turned in up to one week late will be evaluated for 75% credit. No late work will be accepted beyond one week after the original due date.

#### Accommodations

It is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Accommodation requests should be made through the [Disability Resource Center](https://drc.calpoly.edu).

#### Conduct and Academic Integrity

Students are expected to act in awareness of and abide by university policy regarding academic integrity and conduct. Detailed information on these policies, and potential repercussions of policy violations, can be found via the [Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities](https://osrr.calpoly.edu).
