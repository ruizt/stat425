## Announcements

-   HW2 due 10/12 in class
    -   Correction: in 1(iii) assume $n < 20$ instead of $n < 50$ and in 1(iv) assume $n < \text{min}(N + M)$ instead of $n < N + M$
    -   Correction: 3(i) had read ${n \choose k} = (k + 1){n \choose k + 1}$; changed to ${n \choose k} = \frac{k + 1}{n - k}{n \choose k + 1}$
    -   Correction: in 4(ii) and the corresponding part of (iii), it suffices to find upper bounds on the probability of winning each/all prize/s
-   Week 3 notes posted
