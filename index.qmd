> Probability is the mathematics of random events. In the context of modern statistics, probability theory provides a framework for studying the properties of samples, estimators, and inferences (the subjects of STAT 426 and STAT 427). This course will cover the axiomatic formulation of probability and formalize familiar concepts, including basic probability rules, random variables, distributions, and expectations. The course will also introduce concepts that play central roles in statistics, such as joint distributions, transformations, and conditional expectations.
